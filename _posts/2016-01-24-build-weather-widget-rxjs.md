Reactive Programming is a very interesting programming paradigm that I started
pondering with last week, which ended up in
[an article](/reactive-programming-rxruby) on this blog. Today, I will show you
how you can write a very simple weather widget with reactive programming,
using [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS). Or, in other words,
how to do HTTP calls in reactive programming fashion.

## RxJS

RxJS is an acronym for Reactive Extensions for JavaScript. Simply put, it is a
set of libraries to do asynchronous and event-based programming using observable
collections and iterators. Simple as that. If you are interested in diving into
RxJS, which I recommend, you can start with
[the README](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/blob/master/readme.md).
It has plenty of informations and links that you can use to learn Rx.


## The UI

After getting (some of) the RxJS syntax and functions under my belt, I tried to
go on and implement something super simple. In the past, I have worked with the
Open Weather Map's API, so I said to myself, let's build a simple weather widget.

The widget that we will be building will look like this:

This is the default (start) state of the widget. The other state is when the
used populates the input field with his location. Then, the widget fetches the
weather data and shows it:

Very simple, but sufficient for the purpose of this article. As a sidenote, I
will not cover the HTML/CSS part of the widget, as it is quite simple and it's
beside the point of this article.

## The code

We will use the part of the
[Open Weather Map API](http://openweathermap.org/current) which returns the
current weather for a location. First, in our code, we will need to define the
endpoint and the `API_KEY` (to get yours, just register).

Also, make sure you include `RxJS` in your project, whether via a simple
`<script></script>` tag in your HTML file, or via any package manager that you
prefer. We will use the ES6/Babel syntax in this article.

{% highlight javascript %}
const API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE";
const API_URL = `http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?appid=${API_KEY}`;
{% endhighlight %}

Easy as that. Next, we will need to get both of the DOM elements that we need to
work with - the input field and the text paragraph where the temperature will
be shown:

{% highlight javascript %}
var weatherText = document.querySelector('#weather');
var searchInput = document.querySelector('#location-input');
{% endhighlight %}

Now, this is where `Rx` kicks in. We want to grab the `keyup` event on the
input field and kick off a HTTP request after it. This is achievable via the
`Rx.Observable.fromEvent` function, which takes the DOM element and event type
as arguments:

{% highlight javascript %}
Rx.Observable.fromEvent(element, 'event-type');
{% endhighlight %}

Or, in our specific case, we want to grab the `keyup` event on the `searchInput`
DOM element:

{% highlight javascript %}
var searchInputSource = Rx.Observable
  .fromEvent(searchInput, 'keyup')
  .debounce(500);
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see, this is really easy with `RxJS`. As a UX nicety, we use the
`debounce` function, which will make `RxJS` register events 500ms after the last
one is done. Any intermediary events will be rejected. The `searchInputSource`
will be the event source stream. From there, we will map our events, build our
request streams and send the HTTP requests to the API.

{% highlight javascript %}
var requestOnFindStream = searchInputSource.map(ev => {
    return API_URL + "&q=" + ev.target.value;
  });
{% endhighlight %}

Now, this section of the code will `map` all of the events coming through the
`searchInputSource` and build the full request API URLs. At the end of the
`API_URL` it will append a query string with the location specified in the
input field.

{% highlight javascript %}
var responseStream = requestOnFindStream
  .flatMap(requestUrl => {
    return Rx.Observable.fromPromise($.getJSON(requestUrl));
  })
  .map(response => convertToCelsius(response.main.temp))
  .startWith(0);
{% endhighlight %}

Now, here's where all of the magic happens. On the `requestOnFindStream` we
apply the `flatMap` function, whose role here is to build a stream of new
streams. I know, this looks confusing, but bear with me.

In the `flatMap` function, we wrap any incoming `requestUrl` from the
`requestOnFindStream` and we create a new `Rx.Observable` from a jQuery promise.
Later on, when we subscribe on the observable (the `responseStream`), the promise
will be invoked and the data will pass through all of the chained functions.

After the `flatMap`, we map all of the responses that we will get from the
resolved promise and we use the `convertToCelsius` function:

{% highlight javascript %}
function convertToCelsius(kelvin) {
  return (kelvin - 273.15).toFixed(1);
}
{% endhighlight %}

The function is rather simple - it converts Kelvin degrees from Celsius degrees.
After that, we return only the converted temperature from the response body. At
the end, the `startWith` functions just sets a default value for the
`responseStream`, so instead of showing a blank widget, we show 0 degrees
temperature.

As a last step, we need to subscribe to the `requestStream`:

{% highlight javascript %}
responseStream.subscribe(temp => {
  weatherText.innerHTML = `${temp} Â°C`;
});
{% endhighlight %}

This is rather simple - we subscribe to the data stream and set a callback. The
callback will be invoked any time we get any data through the stream. It will
only update the HTML on the widget, showing the temperature to the user.

## Outro

Although Reactive Programming requires a bit of a mindset switch, I found that
programming in the paradigm is quite interesting and challenging. If you want
to dig deeper, I would recommend heading over to Egghead.io and checking their
[courses on Reactive Programming](https://egghead.io/series/introduction-to-reactive-programming).
