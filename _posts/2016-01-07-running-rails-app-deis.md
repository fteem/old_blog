In the last couple of years, we have seen a lot of development in the devops
field. It’s becoming much easier for developers to provision servers and deploy
their applications on those servers just with a couple of key strokes. Since the
start of the SaaS and PaaS products (even before we knew them as that), we have
seen a vast number of companies and communities try to make our lives easier by
developing smart tools that will fit into our workflow seamlessly.

As a side effect, or perhaps intentionally, we’ve also seen the open-source
community create tools to not just make the workflow easier but to cut costs and
enable us to make great software without thinking about the costs of the
hardware.

Amazon with its huge selection of web services ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/))
and the like have made our lives much easier when it comes to incorporating
infrastructure and tools in the cloud. Then there are Chef and Puppet that made
provisioning servers a breeze. Then came containerization in the form of Docker,
although some would argue that containers, or at least the idea around them,
existed well before Docker came along.
