2015 is coming to an end and I decided to look at this years analytics and write
a blog post about it, with some graphics. Let's break this year down and see how
my blog did.

## Articles

Back in February, I decided to start blogging actively and write one post per
week. It was quite challenging and in the last 11 months I managed to write **39
articles**, all of them on software development. Although sometimes it was hard
to find inspiration, I am quite happy with what I achieved. In 2016 I will
continue with blogging and try to deliver even better articles.

Now let's see what were the three most popular articles in the last year.

The most popular article of the year was
[**Rails, Secure Cookies, HSTS and friends**](http://eftimov.net//rails-tls-hsts-cookies/){:target="_blank"}
which got 1612 pageviews or 10.50% of all the pageviews on the blog. I guess
this is due to the article being fetured in the Ruby 5 podcast and in Ruby
Weekly.

Next that follows up is
[**Test Doubles: in theory, in Minitest and in RSpec**](http://eftimov.net//test-doubles-theory-minitest-rspec/){:target="_blank"}
which had 1045 pageviews, or 6.81% of all the pageviews in the last year.

Number three most popular post was
[**How to write Rails middleware**](http://eftimov.net//writing-rails-middleware/){:target="_blank"}
which got 900 pageviews, or 5.86% of all the pageviews.

## Mobile v.s. Desktop Traffic

Since it's the age of the mobile devices, I took a look at the device categories
from where the visitors read my blog.

By far, most of the visitors read my blog from **desktop** - 85.84% or 10.437
sessions. Mobile is 10.89% or 1324 sessions, while tablet is 3.27% of all the
sessions, or 397 sessions.

This is quite worrying data. I have yet to figure out why people prefer
reading mostly on desktop, although the trend is going in the mobile direction.

## Browsers & Operating Systems

Chrome leads by **a ton** - 8140 sessions, or 66.95% of all the sessions.
Second is Firefox, with 1380 sessions, or 11.35%. Third is Safari - 1353
sessions, or 11.13%.

When it comes to operating systems, Macintosh takes the lead with 39.28%. Second
is Windows with 31.01% and Linux is last, with 14.74%.
