My name is Ilija Eftimov, but you can call me Ile. Everyone does.

Welcome to my personal blog. Here, I will be writing about Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
and web development in general. Also, I am planning to write about my journey to
Elixir and functional programming land.

You will also find some posts about general stuff, not just programming. I think that
those will be kept to a minimum.

My day job is as a full-stack Ruby on Rails developer, working for
<a href='http://siyelo.com'>Siyelo</a> as a consultant.

In my spare time, I am the author of couple of tiny Ruby gems, I am one of the
organizers of Rails Girls in Macedonia and I am a part-time programming tutor.

If you have any inquiries, you can also get in touch via <a href="mailto:ileeftimov+blog@gmail.com">email</a>.
You can download my CV <a href="/CV-Ilija-Eftimov.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
